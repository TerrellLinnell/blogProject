        I grew up in Eureka MT, and moved down here to Bozeman my junior year of highschool.
        I moved with my dad because my mom and dad split up. I didnt have a choice to move or not but in the end it worked out for the best, because I got a better education.
        I was originally going to be a petroleum engineer, which is why I filled my schedule with hard classes like Advanced Placement Calculus, Physics, and Engineering, but with the high cost of tuition that didnt workout for me.
        Now I am attending a 3 month coding bootcamp to learn how to be a software developer without the large debt that comes with the computer science degree.
