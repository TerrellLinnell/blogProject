        <p>
        I grew up in Eureka MT, and moved down here to Bozeman my junior year of highschool.
        I moved with my dad because my mom and dad split up.  At first I was a little upset and nervous about starting a new school especially
        one with so many kids. Eureka has about 1500 people total and about 40 kids to a graduating class.  In bozeman there are like 400 kids
        in a graduating class so yeah, I was nervous. In the end it worked out because I got a better education but at the same time it didnt matter
        all that much because im not going to college. Instead I am going to a 3 month coding bootcamp to learn how to be a software developer.  So looking back I wish I had taken
        auto, welding, and woods instead of physics and AP calculus.  But oh well life goes on, im hoping to get a decent job when I finish school.
        So theres a bit about me ðŸ¤”.
